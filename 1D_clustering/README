Problem statement:
Given a data set of 2 attributes Force(N) and Deflection(mm) we have to make clusters of Cantaloupes (or Melons) in three categories namely Ripe, UnRipe and Rotten melons.

This python code implements the Otsu's method of finding threshold for any given function. This solution basically works upon a simulated data set of Cantaloupes. This method helps in making clusters in 1 dimension by normalizating the two given attributes which are Force(N) and Deflection(mm) in to one dimension i.e. Force/Deflection called as flexibility coefiicient.
