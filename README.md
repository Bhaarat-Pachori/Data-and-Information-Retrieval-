This project has the basic implementation of NAive Bayes Classifier in Java. You can use this code to understand how Naive Bayes Classifer works.
A data.zip file is also attach which contains some reviews both positive and negative reviews in train and test folder. 
This implementation gives around an accuracy of 83-84% for classifying the document labels (a given document is positive or negative).

NOTE:
To Run the code successfully download the data.zip file on your system and provide the path to the storing location as a command line argument.
